Halo Custom Edition setup modernized for easier usage

This setup is based on the original Halo Custom Edition setup, but with a few changes to make it
easier to use and more modern.

**WARNING:** This setup DOES NOT allow you to play the game without a valid CD key. You can buy
one from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-PC/dp/B00009TW6R) or other retailers
(if you can find one).

In order to play the game you will need some kind of DRM bypass, we are not going to provide one.
